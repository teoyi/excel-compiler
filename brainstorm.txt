SOT has multiple 
EPOD did not document it 
There is no team in mvbc 

df_sad and df_happy need to be set such that it is all unique 
based on mvbc get document no and service order no 
match it to sot to get all existence of document no and service order no (append to df after creating row?) 
Once matched to sot, fill in the blanks if epod exists with team matched


issue now 

mvbc and sot is matched and there is a df containing mvbc base 

from info get epod match 
and df match 

if df match len > 1: 
    match sot team 
else : 
    just fill epod item 


split df into dictionary 
check for each dictionary 
    document number and service order no and sot team 

    get epod match with document number and service order no  
    if got epod match 
        fill epod values 
    else: 
        continue
